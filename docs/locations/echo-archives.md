# Echo Archives

The Echo Archives are the Council's tightly guarded historical and memory records, located on [Serenos](/docs/planets/serenos.md) and [Earth](/docs/planets/earth.md). They are overseen by the [Bureau of Knowledge](/docs/factions/bureau-of-knowledge.md) and protected by the [CCA](/docs/factions/cca.md), with access restricted by the [Veil](/docs/factions/veil.md).

## Origins & Purpose
The Echo Archives were established after the Unity Wars as the central repository for all historical records, memories, and forbidden knowledge. Overseen by the [Bureau of Knowledge](/docs/factions/bureau-of-knowledge.md), the Archives are both a library and a prison for dangerous truths.

## Security & Access
Access is strictly limited to authorized archivists and memory clerics. The [Veil](/docs/factions/veil.md) maintains hidden chambers for the most sensitive secrets, and the [CCA](/docs/factions/cca.md) enforces compliance with memory purges and surveillance.

## Notable Incidents
- The "Serenos Leak": A memory cleric attempted to smuggle forbidden records to the [Enlightened](/docs/factions/enlightened.md).
- The Councilâ€™s erasure of pre-Unity history following the Ascendancy.
