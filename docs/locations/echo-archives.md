The Echo Archives are the Council's tightly guarded historical and memory records, located on [Serenos](/docs/planets/serenos.md) and [Earth](/docs/planets/earth.md). They are overseen by the [Bureau of Knowledge](/docs/factions/bureau-of-knowledge.md) and protected by the [CCA](/docs/factions/cca.md), with access restricted by the [Veil](/docs/factions/veil.md).
