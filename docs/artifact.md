# The Artifact

The Artifact is a central object of mystery and power in the setting. It is sought by the [Council](/docs/factions/council.md), hidden by the [Veil](/docs/factions/veil.md), and believed to be connected to the [Architects](/docs/factions/architects.md). Knowledge of the Artifact is tightly controlled by the [Bureau of Knowledge](/docs/factions/bureau-of-knowledge.md) and the [CCA](/docs/factions/cca.md), and is a rallying point for the [Enlightened](/docs/factions/enlightened.md).
