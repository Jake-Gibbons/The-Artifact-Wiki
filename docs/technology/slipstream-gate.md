# Slipstream Gate

The Slipstream Gate is the technology enabling interstellar travel, controlled by the [Council](/docs/factions/council.md) and managed by the [Bureau of Expansion](/docs/factions/bureau-of-expansion.md). Access is tightly regulated, with enforcement by the [CCA](/docs/factions/cca.md) and surveillance by the [Bureau of Knowledge](/docs/factions/bureau-of-knowledge.md).

## Council Control and Technology
The [Slipstream Gate](/docs/technology/slipstream-gate.md) network is the backbone of interstellar travel, strictly regulated by the [Council](/docs/factions/council.md). Only authorized ships with Council-encoded beacons can access the gates. The [Bureau of Expansion](/docs/factions/bureau-of-expansion.md) manages expansion and maintenance, while the [CCA](/docs/factions/cca.md) enforces compliance.

## Cultural Impact
The gates are both a symbol of unity and oppressionâ€”enabling commerce and communication, but also isolating rebellious worlds like [Ferros](/docs/planets/ferros.md) and [Oura Station](/docs/planets/oura-station.md) when the Council chooses.
