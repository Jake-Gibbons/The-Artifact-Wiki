# Slipstream Gate

The Slipstream Gate is the technology enabling interstellar travel, controlled by the [Council](/docs/factions/council.md) and managed by the [Bureau of Expansion](/docs/factions/bureau-of-expansion.md). Access is tightly regulated, with enforcement by the [CCA](/docs/factions/cca.md) and surveillance by the [Bureau of Knowledge](/docs/factions/bureau-of-knowledge.md).

## Council Control and Technology
The [Slipstream Gate](/docs/technology/slipstream-gate.md) network is the backbone of interstellar travel, strictly regulated by the [Council](/docs/factions/council.md). Only authorized ships with Council-encoded beacons can access the gates. The [Bureau of Expansion](/docs/factions/bureau-of-expansion.md) manages expansion and maintenance, while the [CCA](/docs/factions/cca.md) enforces compliance.

## Origins
The Slipstream Gate network was developed during the early Council era, based on recovered pre-Unity technology and reverse-engineered alien artifacts. The first gates connected Novasol Prime, Serenos, and Helion Forge, enabling rapid expansion and consolidation of Council power.

## Societal Impact
Slipstream Gates revolutionized trade, migration, and warfare. They allowed the Council to project authority across vast distances, but also made worlds like Ferros and Oura Station vulnerable to blockades and isolation. The gates are a symbol of both progress and oppression.

## Cultural Impact
The gates are both a symbol of unity and oppressionâ€”enabling commerce and communication, but also isolating rebellious worlds like [Ferros](/docs/planets/ferros.md) and [Oura Station](/docs/planets/oura-station.md) when the Council chooses.

## Controversies & Incidents
- The "Ferros Blackout": The Council shut down the local gate to suppress rebellion, causing mass shortages and unrest.
- Smuggling rings on Oura Station have hacked gate protocols, enabling clandestine travel for the Enlightened.
- Rumors persist of lost or hidden gates leading to forbidden sectors or Architect ruins.
