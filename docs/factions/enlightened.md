# The Enlightened

The Enlightened is a decentralized resistance movement within the [Council](/docs/factions/council.md). Its members seek to reveal the truth about the [Veil](/docs/factions/veil.md), the [Artifact](/docs/artifact.md), and the [Architects](/docs/factions/architects.md), and to reform or overthrow the Council's totalitarian regime. The Enlightened often clash with the [CCA](/docs/factions/cca.md) and the [Bureau of Knowledge](/docs/factions/bureau-of-knowledge.md).
