# Bureau of Culture

The Bureau of Culture is the [Council](/docs/factions/council.md)'s bureau for enforcing the [Unity Creed](/docs/concepts/unity-creed.md) and managing ceremonial events, especially on [Earth](/docs/planets/earth.md). It works with the [Bureau of Knowledge](/docs/factions/bureau-of-knowledge.md) to suppress memory cults and with the [Veil](/docs/factions/veil.md) for ideological control.
