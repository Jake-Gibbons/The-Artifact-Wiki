# Bureau of Knowledge

The Bureau of Knowledge is the Council's information control and censorship bureau. It oversees the [Echo Archives](/docs/locations/echo-archives.md) on [Serenos](/docs/planets/serenos.md) and works closely with the [Veil](/docs/factions/veil.md) to suppress forbidden knowledge, especially about the [Artifact](/docs/artifact.md) and the [Architects](/docs/factions/architects.md). It is a key part of the [Council](/docs/factions/council.md)'s apparatus for maintaining the [Unity Creed](/docs/concepts/unity-creed.md).

## Hierarchy & Methods
The Bureau is led by the Grand Archivist, with a network of regional directors on worlds like Serenos and Novasol Prime. Methods include neural editing, information blackouts, and the deployment of memory clerics to erase or rewrite dangerous truths.

## Influence & Notable Agents
- **Grand Archivist Talan:** Ruthless in suppressing forbidden knowledge.
- **Cleric Voss:** Known for his role in the Serenos Leak.
