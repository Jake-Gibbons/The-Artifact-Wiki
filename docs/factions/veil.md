# The Veil

The Veil is a clandestine agency within the [Council](/docs/factions/council.md) that suppresses knowledge of the [Architects](/docs/factions/architects.md) and the [Artifact](/docs/artifact.md). It works closely with the [Bureau of Knowledge](/docs/factions/bureau-of-knowledge.md) and the [CCA](/docs/factions/cca.md) to maintain secrecy and enforce memory purges. The Veil is opposed by the [Enlightened](/docs/factions/enlightened.md).
