# Architects

The Architects are a mysterious group or species referenced by the [Veil](/docs/factions/veil.md) and feared by the [Council](/docs/factions/council.md). Their connection to the [Artifact](/docs/artifact.md) is the subject of intense suppression by the [Bureau of Knowledge](/docs/factions/bureau-of-knowledge.md) and the [CCA](/docs/factions/cca.md).
