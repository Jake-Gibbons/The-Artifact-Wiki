# ðŸ§¬ The Artifact & The Architects

## The Architects
An ancient civilization that achieved consensus-based unity across a thousand worlds.

## Collapse
A gamma-ray burst threatens extinction. The society fractures into three:
- **Stillness**: Accept death.
- **Preservationists**: Archive and end.
- **Continuum**: Build a legacy.

## The Artifact
Created by the Continuum, the Artifact is a biomechanical seed of life and knowledge, sent to Earth.

## Dormancy
It lay inactive for over 100,000 years, subtly guiding evolution, until Lyra awakens it.
