## Overview

## Visual Inspiration
Crowded corridors, neon-lit markets, and a patchwork of cultures and technologies.

## History
Oura Station began as a mining and trade hub on the edge of Council space. Over time, it became a haven for exiles, smugglers, and those fleeing Council control. Its independence is maintained through bribes, shifting alliances, and the threat of open rebellion.

## Governance & Society
The station is run by a loose council of syndicate leaders, Enlightened sympathizers, and former Council officials. Law is enforced by mercenary groups and local militias. The culture is fiercely independent, with a thriving black market and a tradition of sheltering fugitives.

## Notable Figures
- **Captain Ryn:** Charismatic leader of the station’s largest mercenary company.
- **Mira Senn:** Enlightened agent and underground organizer.
