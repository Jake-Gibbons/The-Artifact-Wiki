**Atmosphere:** Quiet, mysterious, and heavily surveilled.

## Overview

- **The Whispering Halls:** Chambers where [memory clerics](/docs/factions/bureau-of-knowledge.md) work.
- **The Obsidian Plaza:** Site of public memory purges by the [Veil](/docs/factions/veil.md).

## Notable Events
- Lyra’s infiltration to uncover the truth about the [Artifact](/docs/artifact.md).
- The [Veil](/docs/factions/veil.md)’s secret operations to erase dissent.

## Visual Inspiration
Towering black libraries, endless rows of data crystals, and silent, robed figures.
