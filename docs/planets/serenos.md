# Serenos

**Role:** Archive planet and repository of forbidden knowledge  
**Atmosphere:** Quiet, mysterious, and heavily surveilled.

## Overview
Serenos is home to the [Echo Archives](/docs/locations/echo-archives.md), where the [Council](/docs/factions/council.md) stores and censors historical records. Its surface is dotted with monolithic libraries and data vaults, shrouded in mist.

## Key Locations
- **Echo Archives:** The largest collection of pre-Council history.
- **The Whispering Halls:** Chambers where [memory clerics](/docs/factions/bureau-of-knowledge.md) work.
- **The Obsidian Plaza:** Site of public memory purges by the [Veil](/docs/factions/veil.md).

## History
Originally a remote research outpost, Serenos was transformed into the Council’s central archive world after the Unity Wars. Its population is composed mainly of archivists, memory clerics, and security personnel, all sworn to secrecy.

## Government & Society
Serenos is governed directly by the [Bureau of Knowledge](/docs/factions/bureau-of-knowledge.md), with strict surveillance and limited civilian rights. The local culture values silence, discretion, and loyalty to the Council’s narrative.

## Notable Figures
- **Archivist Lirae:** Chief custodian of the Echo Archives, rumored to possess forbidden memories.
- **Cleric Voss:** Enforcer of memory purges, feared for his unwavering loyalty to the Veil.

## Notable Events
- Lyra’s infiltration to uncover the truth about the [Artifact](/docs/artifact.md).
- The [Veil](/docs/factions/veil.md)’s secret operations to erase dissent.
