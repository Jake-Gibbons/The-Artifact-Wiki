## History
Ferros was once the industrial heart of the early Council, fueling expansion with its vast factories and mines. Decades of exploitation led to environmental collapse and mass unrest, making it the birthplace of the [Enlightened](/docs/factions/enlightened.md) resistance.

## Governance & Society
Officially ruled by a Council-appointed overseer, real power often lies with local syndicates and rebel leaders. Daily life is harsh, with most citizens working in dangerous conditions. A strong sense of solidarity and underground culture persists among the workers.

## Notable Figures
- **Overseer Karr:** The Councilâ€™s iron-fisted administrator, known for brutal crackdowns.
- **Jax Renn:** Charismatic leader of the Enlightened on Ferros.
