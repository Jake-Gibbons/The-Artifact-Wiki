## üåå Setting & Worldbuilding

Humanity's civilization is spread across a network of core worlds and outposts, each with its own role and atmosphere:
- **Novasol Prime**: The cold, elegant capital where the Council rules from orbiting megacities above a planet-wide ocean.
- **Ferros**: An industrial wasteland, birthplace of rebellion and the Enlightened resistance.
- **Serenos**: Archive planet, home to the Echo Archives and the Whispering Halls, where history is censored and memory clerics work.
- **Myrath**: A paradise world for the elite, hiding secret prisons and research labs beneath its gardens.
- **Oura Station**: A chaotic, vibrant fringe outpost, haven for outcasts and resistance cells.
- **Earth**: Preserved as a ceremonial world, sacred and enigmatic, with hidden ruins and forbidden truths beneath its surface.

Technologies like **Slipstream Gates** and **Jump Drives** enable travel, while **Bound AIs** and the mysterious **Ghostnet** shape society and culture. The Council enforces the **Unity Creed** and suppresses memory cults and forbidden knowledge.

## üß¨ The Artifact & The Architects

The **Architects** were an ancient civilization that achieved unity across a thousand worlds. Facing extinction, they fractured: some accepted death, others archived their legacy, and the **Continuum** created the Artifact‚Äîa biomechanical seed of life and knowledge, sent to Earth. Dormant for 100,000 years, the Artifact subtly guided evolution until Lyra awakens it, setting the story in motion.
