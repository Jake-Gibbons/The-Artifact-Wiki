## ✨ Premise

In the far future, humanity spans the stars under the rigid control of the **Council of Worlds**. When reclusive astrophysicist **Lyra Quen** uncovers an ancient alien device—the **Artifact**—she stumbles into an ideological war that will determine the future of civilization.

Two factions emerge:

- **The Veil**, determined to keep humanity ignorant.
- **The Enlightened**, willing to risk chaos to reveal the truth.

Lyra must choose: protect the lie or ignite a reckoning.
