# Unity Creed

The Unity Creed is the state religion and ideological foundation of the [Council](/docs/factions/council.md). It is enforced by the [Bureau of Culture](/docs/factions/bureau-of-culture.md) and the [CCA](/docs/factions/cca.md), and is a key justification for censorship by the [Bureau of Knowledge](/docs/factions/bureau-of-knowledge.md). Dissenters are often targeted by the [Veil](/docs/factions/veil.md).

## Origins
The Unity Creed was established by the first Council High Chancellors as a unifying doctrine after the chaos of the Unity Wars. Drawing on fragments of old Earth religions and Council propaganda, it was designed to erase cultural divisions and justify the Council’s absolute authority.

## Societal Impact
The Creed is taught from birth and reinforced through daily rituals, public ceremonies, and neural conditioning. It shapes language, art, and even personal relationships, making dissent not just illegal but unthinkable for most citizens.

## Cultural Enforcement
The [Unity Creed](/docs/concepts/unity-creed.md) is not just a religion but a tool of social engineering. The [Bureau of Culture](/docs/factions/bureau-of-culture.md) and [Bureau of Knowledge](/docs/factions/bureau-of-knowledge.md) use it to justify memory edits, language control, and the suppression of forbidden rituals. Ceremonies on [Earth](/docs/planets/earth.md) reinforce the myth of human unity and the Council’s divine mandate.

## Controversies & Resistance
- Secret societies on Ferros and Oura Station preserve banned texts and pre-Council traditions.
- The Enlightened use coded language and underground art to subvert the Creed’s influence.
- Memory clerics on Serenos are rumored to secretly question the Creed’s truth.

## Dissent and Resistance
Rebels, especially the [Enlightened](/docs/factions/enlightened.md), subvert the Creed by reviving lost languages and forbidden histories, often at great personal risk.
