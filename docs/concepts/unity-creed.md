# Unity Creed

The Unity Creed is the state religion and ideological foundation of the [Council](/docs/factions/council.md). It is enforced by the [Bureau of Culture](/docs/factions/bureau-of-culture.md) and the [CCA](/docs/factions/cca.md), and is a key justification for censorship by the [Bureau of Knowledge](/docs/factions/bureau-of-knowledge.md). Dissenters are often targeted by the [Veil](/docs/factions/veil.md).

## Cultural Enforcement
The [Unity Creed](/docs/concepts/unity-creed.md) is not just a religion but a tool of social engineering. The [Bureau of Culture](/docs/factions/bureau-of-culture.md) and [Bureau of Knowledge](/docs/factions/bureau-of-knowledge.md) use it to justify memory edits, language control, and the suppression of forbidden rituals. Ceremonies on [Earth](/docs/planets/earth.md) reinforce the myth of human unity and the Councilâ€™s divine mandate.

## Dissent and Resistance
Rebels, especially the [Enlightened](/docs/factions/enlightened.md), subvert the Creed by reviving lost languages and forbidden histories, often at great personal risk.
